[DEPRECATED]
This project should not be used. Instead use the official smithy Directed codegen: https://smithy.io/2.0/guides/building-codegen/index.html
Im going to re-start a new project for generating java code using the official smithy approach

# sgf4j
Smithy Generation Framework for Java. A plugin-centric framework, sgf4j uses `javapoet` to generate java code from an [aws smithy](https://smithy.io/2.0/index.html) specification. 

sgf4j supports either: 
1. Annotation processor-based code generation (supported)
2. CLI tool for generating code (in progress)

sgf4j is a plugin-based architecture that allows for a great deal of flexibility for the end user. By defining custom plugins you can overwrite or modify almost any behavior of the framework to support your use case.
